        <p>The future of the A.G.R.C. league</p>
        <pre>After nearly 2 years after the first race in the A.G.R.C. in the year 2048, problems show in the idea of a Anti gravgit ity racing leauge being hosted in dense urban settings.
The main problem being that the sheer destructtive force of weapons and craft themselves are likely to almost lay waste to urban areas, skyrocketing the prices to repair them.
Thus, Mr Belmondo is very concerned about this and he later announced Project ALTIMA shortly after.</pre>

        <p>Pir-hana showing off their new Prototype</p>
        <pre>Pir-hana showed off their new speed focused Prototype that is supposed to outrun every ship currently in comission.
To compensate for this immense amount of speed, it is rumoured that Pir-hana have completely toned down on shield technology and handling. 
We look forward to seeing this awesome beast of a vehicle sprinting down our tracks!</pre>
